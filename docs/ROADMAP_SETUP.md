# Roadmap Channel Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up and use the dynamic roadmap system for the EFD Discord Bot.

## 🎯 Overview

The roadmap system provides:
- **Transparent Development Tracking** - Community can see exactly what's being worked on
- **Automatic Progress Updates** - Roadmap updates in real-time as development progresses  
- **Phase Completion Announcements** - Automated celebrations when new features go live
- **Rich Visual Progress Bars** - Easy-to-understand progress indicators

## 🚀 Initial Setup

### 1. Channel Setup
The following channels are configured:
- **Roadmap Channel**: `1416844033493565643` (#roadmap)
- **Announcements Channel**: `1416592963709964308` (#announcements)

Set permissions so everyone can view but only admins can post in the roadmap channel.

### 2. Initialize Roadmap Data
```
/roadmap-admin init
```
This loads all phase data from the documentation into the database.

### 3. Set Up Auto-Updates
```
/roadmap-admin setup-auto-updates roadmap_channel:1416844033493565643 announcements_channel:1416592963709964308
```
This configures:
- Automatic roadmap updates in the roadmap channel
- Phase completion announcements in the announcements channel
- Pinned roadmap message that stays updated

1. Roadmap automatically updates to show 100% complete
2. Celebration announcement is posted in announcements channel
3. Community is notified about new features
4. Development team gets recognition
